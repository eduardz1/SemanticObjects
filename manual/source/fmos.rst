Functional Mock-Up Objects
==========================
.. highlight:: EBNF

SMOL implements *functional mock-up objects* (FMOs), encapsulations of *functional mock-up units* (FMUs) as defined by the *functional mock-up interface* (FMI) 2.0.2.
An FMO is an abstraction that integrates the FMU into the language; it is a special objects with the inputs and outputs of an FMU as properties/fields
and special statements that initialize and advance it. It does not not belong to a class, but its inputs and outputs define an FMO-type, on which a subtyping relation is given.

Syntax
------

Syntactically, FMOs are treated as special objects with distinct *FMO-types* and a distinct statement for their instantiation.

Types
^^^^^

The type of an FMO contains the list of all its inputs and all its outputs. 
Syntactically, an *FMO-type* has the following form: The keyword ``Cont``, followed by a comma-separated list for inputs, a semicolon and a comma-separated list for outputs.
The lists are enclosed in brackets.
::

  TYPE ::= ... | 'Cont' '[' Ins? ';' Outs? ']' 
  Ins  ::= 'in' TYPE NAME ( ',' Ins)?
  Outs ::= 'out' TYPE NAME ( ',' Outs)?
 
Each input of the underlying FMO that is to be written must be declared via ``in TYPE NAME`` within the first list of type, 
and every output that is to be read must be declared via ``out TYPE NAME``.

The type of an input or output is the SMOL equivalent according to the following table:

========= =======
FMI 2.0.2 SMOL
========= =======
Real      Double
Booean    Boolean
String    String
Integer   Int
========= =======

The type for FMOs without any inputs and outputs is ``Cont[;]``.

FMO-types are covariant:
An FMO-type ``T = Cont[in Ti1 i1,... ; out To1 o1...]`` is a subtype of another FMO-type ``S = Cont[in Sj1 j1,... ; out Sp1 p1...]`` 
if (1) each input ``i`` of ``T`` is also an input ``i`` of ``S``, such that the type of ``i`` in ``T`` is a subtype of the type of ``i`` in ``S``, and 
(2) each output ``i`` of ``T`` is also an ouput ``i`` of ``S``, such that the type of ``i`` in ``T`` is a subtype of the type of ``i`` in ``S``.

Statements
^^^^^^^^^

The ``simulate`` statement takes a path to an FMU and a list of variable initializers, which initialize the FMO.
The ``doStep`` statement targets an expression with an FMO-type and takes a ``Double`` typed expression as a parameter.
::

  Statement ::= ... | (Type? NAME '=')? 'simulate' '(' STRING (',' VarInits)?')' 
                    | Expression '.' 'doStep' '(' Expression ')'
  VarInits  ::= NAME '=' LITERAL (',' VarInits)? 

The variable initializers must target inputs or parameters of the FMU and respect typing.
The string parameter must be a path to an FMU with a model description for co-simulation.
If the path is relative, then it must be relative to the directory where the SMOL runtime is run.

.. highlight:: Java

The following shows how an FMO is loaded and passed as a parameter.
::

  class C(Cont[ ; out Int i] fmo) end

  main 
    Cont[in Int j; out Int i] cont = simulate("path/to/fmu", j=1, k=1);
    C c = new C(cont);
  end


Semantics
---------

The fields and methods of an FMO are auto-generated: there is one field for every input and one field for every ouput.
Assigning to a field that is an output
triggers at a compile-time error. 
Reading a field that is an input 
triggers a compile-time warning. [#footnoteinout]_
Each such operation results in a call to ``fmi2SetXXX``, resp. ``fmi2GetXXX``, an FMO does not buffer read or written values itself.

Addtionally, each FMO has a field ``role`` of ``String`` type and a field ``offset`` of integer type, which play a role in their semantic lifting and is explained below.
These fields can be read and written and are not connceted to the encapsulated FMU.

The ``doStep`` statement advances the encapsulated FMU by ``t`` time units. It results
in a call to ``doStep`` of the encapsulated FMU.

The following shows how an FMO is loaded and manipulated. 
::

  main 
    Cont[in Int j; out Int i] cont = simulate("path/to/fmu", j=1, k=1);
    cont.role = "Example FMO";
    cont.doStep(0.1);
    Int v = cont.i;
    cont.j = v+1;
  end

  

Semantical Lifting
------------------

Semantical lifting of FMOs is under development. Currently, they are *completely* ommited from the generated knowledge graph.
